# Crispin Mulberry

A small website made for a skills test

## Notes

- I did not have access to Photoshop for this project
- Because of the above I used Google to find other applicants versions of this to get some assets that I assume were slices in the PSD (i.e. logo)
- CSS gradients generated with http://www.gradientapp.com/
- Updated carousel script to output BEM classes

## Time log
- Day 1: 3.5 hours, got to [this](https://github.com/sambrannon/crispin-mulberry/commit/cf50d6a581015076a26dba4320e4f519a0f5f47b) commit
